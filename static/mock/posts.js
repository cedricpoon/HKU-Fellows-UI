    "content": `Eminent domain is **the process of government acquiring property or land with compensation to the property owners**. They can only take it for **public purposes**, such as infrastructures. The government will have to compensate the property owners in fair market value. In Hong Kong, the Basic Law protects the right of property owners in such a capitalist city. According to [Chapter 5 of the Basic Law in Hong Kong](https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/pda/en/basiclawtext/chapter_5.html)

    >Article 105
    >The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, in accordance with law, protect the right of individuals and legal persons to the acquisition, use, disposal and inheritance of property and their right to compensation for lawful deprivation of their property.
    >Such compensation shall correspond to the real value of the property concerned at the time and shall be freely convertible and paid without undue delay.
    >The ownership of enterprises and the investments from outside the Region shall be protected by law.

    Protected by this law, if the government fails to compensate the owners, the owners have the right to sue the government.

    On the other hand, zoning is a process which **the government restricts the use of land based on where the land is located**. It is simply a public control over the private properties. No compensation is required to be given to property owners. Property owners are not happy with such practice as they will face a loss of financial interest. Yet,    it is very popular among the local government planners as it doesnâ€™t cost the govt any besides the consultation fee of zoning.

    When the government carries out eminent domain, they are also required to compensate the land owners who are being affected. When talking about zoning, it is just a planning practice which limits the use of land in the certain area. **For example, a factory is not allowed to be built next to residential area.** It is the right to regulate the private parties for the sake of public interest.
